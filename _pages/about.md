Hello, my name is Jeffrey Chan, a student from the applied mathematics program at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, and [Puerto Rico LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Fellow](https://prlsamp.rcse.upr.edu/index.php/home/bridge-to-the-doctorate-program){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working with the [BigDBee Project](https://bigdbee.hpcf.upr.edu/), focusing on self-supervised models for the robust re-identification of honeybees in their natural habitat. Among my research interests are self-supervision, computer vision, and representation learning in order to reduce human supervision.

I received a B.Sc in Computer Science with a double concentration in mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras (2019). As ICPC Contestant, my team reached the Caribbean finals two years in a row (2016, 2017).

I enjoy cooking, I am not Gordon Ramsey, but you can find me constantly improving recipes to make it my own by mixing with Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and Chinese cuisine. Among my favorite recipes are pesto fettuccini with rib-eye steak, [Peruvian _Lomo Salteado_](https://tasty.co/recipe/peruvian-lomo-saltado), and my version of chicken chow mein with fried plantains.
