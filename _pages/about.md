I am a graduate student from the applied mathematics program at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, and [Puerto Rico LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate](https://prlsamp.rcse.upr.edu/index.php/home/bridge-to-the-doctorate-program){:target="_blank"} Fellow. As a BigDBee Project member, my research focuses on self-supervised models for the robust re-identification of honeybees in their natural habitat.

Among my research interests are disentangled representations, self-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning with a focus on the animal re-identification towards robust monitoring systems.  

I received a B.Sc in Computer Science with a double concentration in mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras (2019). As ICPC Contestant, my team reached Caribbean finals in two years in a row (2016-2017).

I love cooking, I am not Gordon Ramsey, but you can find me always improving recipes to make it my own. Between my favorite dishes to cook fettuccini with rib-eye steak, [butter burgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIErqYP8KNU){:target="_blank"}  and my version of chicken chow mein.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
