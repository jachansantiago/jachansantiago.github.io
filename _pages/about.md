Hello, my name is Jeffrey Chan. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Vision at the University of Central Florida (UCF), where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Mubarak Shah](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/person/mubarak-shah/){:target="_blank"} in the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV). I am a proud [GEM Fellow](https://www.gemfellowship.org/2022-gem-fellows/){:target="_blank"} and an ORC Fellow at UCF.

My research focuses on dataset distillation and improving the efficiency of deep learning training—particularly in settings with limited computational resources. I’m especially interested in rethinking how we use data and supervision to develop models that are smaller, faster, and just as effective as their larger counterparts.

Before UCF, I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a double concentration in Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras (2019). During my undergraduate studies, I was a [Puerto Rico LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Fellow](https://prlsamp.rcse.upr.edu/index.php/home/bridge-to-the-doctorate-program){:target="_blank"} and contributed to the [BigDBee Project](https://bigdbee.hpcf.upr.edu/), where I developed self-supervised models for robust honeybee re-identification in natural environments. My early research interests included self-supervised learning, representation learning, and reducing human supervision in computer vision pipelines.

I also competed as an ICPC contestant, where my team qualified for the Caribbean Finals in both 2016 and 2017.

Outside of research, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen. While I’m no Gordon Ramsay, I love reimagining recipes and blending Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and Chinese flavors. Some of my favorite creations include pesto fettuccine with ribeye steak, [Peruvian _Lomo Saltado_](https://tasty.co/recipe/peruvian-lomo-saltado), and my own take on chicken chow mein with fried plantains.
