TraceSpace is a concept to edit digitalized architectural plans based on the analog workflow to correct plans with layers. TraceSpace was initially was developed as a multi-touch desk developed by _Centro de Investigación y Diseño (CIDI)_ at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. More information about this first iteration is [here](https://cidi.online/?page_id=2606) . This second iteration was a web application focused on collaborative interactions. Like Google Docs for architectural plan editing. This new web-based application allows multiples users anywhere on the Earth to collaborate on the creation of architectural plans.
